A patch of dew slick leaves broke loose and skated sideways under his toe. Not much. Half a boot width. Nearly nothing. A fraction of a fraction. The distance between life and death.
 
His other foot missed the landing. A tiny slip to the right had thrown his balance mid stride. He felt his left ankle roll under him as he tried to find solid purchase on loose sticks and pebbles and rapidly browning leaves. He let his legs collapse under him. His hands flew up reflexively, briefly touching down on drying pine needles before he caught himself and tucked up into a clumsy shoulder roll. A hundred small bites stung the heels of his hands. He pulled his legs in just barely missing the trunk of a thin coniferous.

The millisecond he felt back in some sort of control, he rolled back up onto his feet aiming to keep as much momentum as he could. He planted his left leg down firmly, testing for any damage or weakness in his ankle. Finding none, he pushed like a sprinter off starting blocks.
 
Surely they must have heard that. There was no way they didn’t. Maybe the forest dampened the sound. Maybe the tracker was headed in the wrong direction. Maybe.

He lept over a narrow creek and angled toward an area with thicker growth. A dark spot in the forest where shafts of early morning sun couldn’t quite make their way through. A spot to hunker down and catch his breath. A spot to look over his hands and legs and assess any damage.

With the darkened patch of forest only a few steps away, he had to fight down the urge to turn away and keep running. If there was a safe haven somewhere in this forest the only way to get there would be to run. Run as hard and as fast as he could. Let abject terror propel him.

He overruled the urge. If he needed to run, if he needed to fight, he would have to make sure that he wasn’t already critically injured. He would need to save up some stamina for a sprint. Better to stop briefly than to run himself to death. That’s what trackers did, right? They would run down their quarry. Force him to burn through his reserves and move in when he was no longer any threat.

He angled his shoulders and ducked his head to avoid the reaching branches of a poplar. The sharp tip of one brushed across his cheek and he flinched away pinching that eye tight. He continued well into the shaded spot hoping that it would be tough to catch sight of him from the relatively clear woods surrounding this grove.

He slunk in tight against a base of a tall evergreen, well beneath a heavy bough. Shelter enough he hoped.

He forced long smooth breaths. He could feel the speed of his heart in his throat and heard the blood whooshing through his ears. More slow breaths and he imagined he could feel his pulse falling. 

As quietly as he could, he rolled that ankle in small circles. Everything seemed fine. While he was running there was the possibility that he had masked an injury with adrenaline. He was rested enough now, even after a few seconds, to rule that out.

Okay, last thing. He reached into his left hip pocket and pulled out the thin cylinder of paste. The rectangular gauge on the side sat at about 75%. Not great but it could be worse. He popped off the cap and rolled a thin layer paste onto the heel of his left hand. He quickly snapped the cap back on so that the ball applicator wouldn’t dry out and rubbed his hands together. He could have sworn that the gauge on the tube had decreased ever so slightly. He needed to save as much paste as possible. A serious injury could use up an entire tube, and he didn’t have an entire tube to begin with. Smearing the stingy amount he had applied across both hands probably wouldn’t be enough to properly heal the scrapes, but he shouldn’t have to worry about an infection. 

He double checked that the cap was fully on and tucked the tube back into his pocket.

He took a set of slow deep breaths, pulling the relatively cool shaded air deep into his lungs. He closed his eyes tightly for a few more breaths hoping that the change in illumination would make him more perceptive when he opened them again.

He brushed his fingers over the glass plate sewn into the cuff of his flight suit. 13:43. 13:44. 13:45. Not even 14 minutes since the horn sounded.

Off to his left, deeper into the darkness of the forest, he heard the hollow crack and slow impacts of heavy branches falling. A series of groaning crashes before a single, definite thud. It could be that a tracker knocked a branch loose from a tree while climbing to a perch. It could have been on purpose to flush him out. It could have been natural deadfall, or the work of an animal. It could have been caused by so many things. No matter what caused the noise, it forced him into a decision. 

Stay put, or continue running. If a tracker didn’t cause the noise, there was no way they didn’t hear it. Someone would be investigating and the felled tree was too nearby to ignore.
Stay or run.

His ankle was uninjured as far as he could tell.

Run then?

Run.

He ducked under the evergreen boughs tucking his chin so that the needles that caught him only brushed against the collar of his flight suit.

He turned and ran back the way he came. He had estimated the direction that the sound of falling timber had come from, so he angled away from that as best he could. So not quite doubling back, but near to it.

He had absolutely no idea where the ship was.

That was part of the plan, he thought. The plan to disorent him. Make him easier prey. The ship was sitting somewhere in a clearing in this forest. It couldn’t be too far away. He imagined it sitting just like he left it, with the ramp down and the engines in standby.

From down here, dashing from tree trunk to tree trunk, it was impossible to fully get his bearings. He could see light from the sun cutting through branches. That helped keep him from running in circles. It got him no closer to finding the ship and getting the hell out of here.
For a millisecond light lanced down through the trees blinding him. One moment the dull dark light of the forest was defying him to keep up his running pace. Dodging branches, jumping over roots and rocks. The next moment the world went completely white. When it returned he stopped absolutely dead in his tracks. How he went from a full run to standing stock still he didn’t know. Why he did was obvious.

A massive brown and black shape shifted about twenty meters dead ahead of him.
