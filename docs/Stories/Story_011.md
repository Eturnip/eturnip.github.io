Kara stared down at her legs. Her legs could win marathons and conquer triathlons. Legs that carried her through long races up steep mountain inclines until the air was so thin she felt she would never fill her lungs again. Those same legs carried her back down keeping pace the whole way. Her legs could run 400 meters at a dead sprint in just over a minute. As a distance runner the 400 was never her race, but that was still respectable. Her legs trained and worked and pushed with a purpose for the last 3 years. They completed relentless runs with her older sister far longer than that. Triathlons all over the world.  Olympic team tryouts. They never gave up. Even when other parts of her wanted to. The problem wasn’t her legs. 

She stared down at them. They stared back at her. 

They wanted to run. She could tell. They were, after all, her legs. When they wanted to run they could hardly hide that from her. Her legs loved to run.

“Kara Lynn Liu? Hello Ms. Lui, I’m Dr. Dawson.”

She knew Dr. Dawson of course. Sandy haired, stockily built, never maintains eye contact. Dr. Dawson had introduced herself this exact way the last two times they had met. Dr. Dawson was also one of the best bioelectronic physiatrists in the world. Dr. Dawson was also one of the most confounding people that Kara had ever spoken with. Kenzie would know how to talk to Dr. Dawson. She wished Kenzie were here.

Kara responded with a bright and even genuine “Hello, nice to see you again.”

Dr. Dawson smiled slightly but never lifted her eyes from her tablet.

“Ms. Lui, can you follow me please?.”

Kara hadn’t run for 27 days. She counted them. 2 days in bed while the bone glue and temporary stabilizers set. 2 days of nurses helping her in and out of the chair so she could ‘get used to it’. 12 days of ramming into walls and IV stands in the hospital. Another 11 in her apartment colliding with the bathroom doorway, her coffee table, and the kitchen counter. Nothing in her apartment was built to accomodate a wheelchair. She wasn’t built to accomodate a wheelchair. 

She had felt awful when she ran over her cat's tail. Rupert was just dangling it out from under the bed. She hadn’t seen him in the dark. He walked a wide arc around the chair wheels after that. It took days before he would jump up onto her lap again. She absently noted that she could no longer feel the landing of his paws when he did.

Kenzie had been with her in the hospital. Sat by her bed. Slept in the chair. Kenzie had gone back home with her for those first few days to help get her settled. Kenzie installed the bars for her toilet and shower. When Kenzie had started to cook for her, Kara had insisted that she go back home. 

She had played on her sister’s guilt. Leaving Micheal and little Alex alone for so long was killing her. Kara could see the cracks forming and proceeded to pick at them.

Kara then offered the facts. The clinic was monitoring her vitals for the prosthetic research group remotely anyway. They would know if she had fallen even before she hit the ground. She couldn’t pee without Dr. Dawson logging it in a spreadsheet. The chair was on loan and had location tags built into it that the university could track. The last of her lingering sponsorships had provided her with more powdered, nutrient balanced, meal replacement than she could eat in a year. She was only going to be home for a couple weeks. All cold hard facts that Kenzie couldn’t ignore. Kenzie ran on facts. Facts were the best weapons.

This was always the way it had been between them. Advice turned to coaching. Coaching turned to management. Management turned to smothering. When Kara had enough of that she would remind Kenzie that they both had their own lives and send her on her way. The last time was just before Alex was born. This was just another example of the system at work.

When Kenzie left in the morning, she didn’t say goodbye.

All told, it had been 27 days not running. 27 days not training. 27 days of hoping.

By the time she reoriented herself and began pushing the wheels forward in unison, Dr. Dawson had already disappeared down the hall and into her exam room off to the right. 23 days and she hadn’t really figured out how to use the chair. She had told herself that it didn’t matter. She didn’t want to figure it out. Dr. Dawson was going to get her running again.

“Kara Lynn-”

“It’s just Kara”

“Okay,” Dr. Dawson briefly flicked her eyes up from her tablet but totally failed to focus on anything. “Kara”

“T11 to L3 Bridge with L1 wrap and reinforcement.” Dr. Dawson muttered into her tablet.

Kara felt the urge to pipe up even though she was fairly sure that Dr. Dawson wasn’t talking to her. “Yes, that’s what you recommended. The first time we met.”

Dr. Dawson just hummed to herself and kept reading and swiping on the tablet with one finger.

Then she stopped. The reading, the humming, the swiping all stopped. She stared deeply into the blank eggshell wall. She stared for an uncomfortably long time. 

“You used to run, right?”

Past tense. 


Kara Spent the last weeks never speaking in past tenses. This was an injury. Like a sprain or a tear or a break. Something that needed treatment and rehab, maybe even a lot of rehab. No mention of running in the past tense ever left her mouth. She hadn’t let it. 

Katie Winstead, 10 meter diving 

Martin Krell, Formula E1

Zhang Xi, Snowboard Cross

All of them, competing again only weeks or months after devastating accidents. They had all sustained injuries that would have ended their careers less than a decade ago. A few decades before that, not one of them would have walked again. Martin would probably never have been able to breath on his own. Xi has a carbotanium wrapped femur, pelvis, and lower spine. Each one of them recovered and returned back to the top of their sport. All of them owed their recovery, at least in part, to Dr. Dawson. Restorative surgeries like these had become so mundane not even the local news covered them anymore. But there were always exceptions.

“You used to run, Right?” 

“I do.” Kara choked out the words. “I do run.”

Dr. Dawson kept staring at the wall. When she slowly turned to look at Kara it was with dawning recognition, as though Dr. Dawson just set eyes on an old friend. She was smiling a broad and warm smile. She wore it poorly.

When she spoke again she was animated and quick, snapping off each phrase.

“I’ve been thinking about this instead. Full T1 to L5 wrap and bypass. Passive bridges introduce lag and need multiple open ports for upkeep. We can shunt your whole column over to superconducting optoelectronic fibers. Better recovery and less rehab time if you aren’t waiting for grafts to heal.”

Dr. Dawson spun the tablet around to show Kara a 3 dimensional representation of her spine. Images collected from far too many scans. About 2 thirds of the way down, the vertebrae went from solid distinct shapes to collections of loose gravel. Right in that spot. The spot where the delivery truck had hit her while she was training on her bike. The spot where she had become separated from her legs.

Dr. Dawson jabed just above that spot and a ring menu appeared. She slid her finger to the upper quadrant. An array of options fanned out from that point and she selected one of them.

On the screen, Kara watched as a series of highlighted points cascaded from the top of the hips all the way up to the base of the neck.

A wave of heat swept through her chased by a clammy chill. Something about the images were off putting and alluring all at once.

The model spine dimmed before being overdrawn by a new, sleek black lattice structure. It was like a spider's web woven into the shape of a spine. The length of it appeared to be adorned with six tiny glowing jewels connected in pairs. Kara thought it looked beautiful. She watched as this new spine squirmed into place grappling on to the structures of the skeleton. Spiral tendrils extending, clasping onto Ribs and vertebrae. 

Kara took several long slow breaths in an effort to hold back the disorientation she was feeling.

Dr. Dawson flipped the tablet back toward herself and grinned at it.

“The best part is, these are all proven prosthetics so they are fairly low risk. Just, no one has ever used it for a full spine. Or done this.” Dr. Dawson tapped her finger on one of the jewels. “The embedded processors filter, amplify, and accelerate all downstream nerve trunks. We normally only use them in full replacements or radical bipasses when there is damage too severe for bridging. We normally use them to boost atrophied pathways. In your case they should increase legacy nerve response well past your baseline and keep your autonomic nervous system running if anything else goes wrong. In the case of full system failure they fall back to your existing column and you climb back into the chair and come in for repairs” 

She raised one eyebrow slightly in an attempt to look conspiratorial. It didn’t totally land, but Kara appreciated the effort. Dr. Dawson’s words tumbled out in one excited breath. 

“Not only do I think this would be your best bet for a rapid recovery, but it would technically be experimental. We can get the whole thing paid for under the R&D budget. Thanks to your elite athlete status we can rope in the University and some government grants, and it’s all covered. You would just have to agree to the elective surgery and the ongoing research project.”

Dr. Dawson swiped a few times on her tablet and then spun it back around. On it was a page full of text and a line for a signature. Kara’s eyes had trouble focusing.

“We can have the whole substructure printed and conductivity tested by the end of the week. That’s all done in house. I would be overseeing the surgery and, of course, Dr. Mboya will install the nerve junctions. He is the best in the field. Incisions so small they’re barely enough to draw blood. we will have to leave a single small port between your shoulder blades. The guide markings for it look like a sort of circular tattoo. You can tell people that you’re in a geometry gang”

Kara could see in Dr. Dawson’s sly grin that she had been waiting to use this particular joke.

“It takes about 36 hours for all of the extensions to bond and the junctions to reach full conductivity. During that time we will have to keep you awake but paralyzed. Bring a book to listen to. We will have to keep you at the research center during your rehab period in case of possible infection, blood clots, etc. We also need to keep the processors in range of the local intranet during their training phase. That’s around 90 days. You will need to be in limited isolation for the first while to prevent vertebral osteomyelitis. Room and board is included in the research project.”

Kara breathed audibly and reached up to wipe cold sweat from her forehead. Dr. Dawson, for the first time, looked directly at her. 

“Are you okay?” 

Kara spoke, but the words sounded distant to her, like they weren’t in her own voice. She didn’t even know what prompted her to say what she did. 

“Will I be able to run again?”

Dr. Dawson smiled with all of her teeth and pushed her glasses back up her nose.

“The question isn’t will you be able to run, it’s how fast.”

As promised, after a full day and a half of existing in a semi conscious haze and another day and half being so exhausted she wasn’t sure if she was awake or not, Kara was able to stand. Only for a few minutes at a time and with almost no sense of balance or feeling. The separation from her legs had been so complete that it wasn’t going to come back all at once, or at least that was what they told her. But on that 3rd day, she did stand. She had prepared herself for the balance issues. The part that she hadn’t been ready for was how her hands and arms felt like dull weights hanging from her shoulders. The lack of sensation extended all the way up to her lower jaw. Her tongue felt thick in her mouth and the only indication she had of her own breathing was air passing through her nose. She no longer needed a catheter, but she hated the computer monitored diaper with every one of it’s cheery alarms. Still, most importantly, she was able to stand. She reminded herself that a race is run one step at a time. The reminder was in Kenzie’s voice.

She remembered Kenzie being beside her bed when she was lying face down, head resting in a donut shaped pillow, but she couldn’t be certain that it had actually happened. Kenzie wasn’t there when Kara’s head had cleared. Instead of talking with her sister Kara chose to count the grid of tiles on the floor.

Kara remembered Dr. Dawson checking in on her twice. She only ever stood by the door, peering through the plastic tent around Kara’s bed. She nodded at her tablet and said “everything looks good” and then left.

After moving to the rehab research wing of the university, Kara spent the next two weeks of her scheduled 3 month recovery on nerve blockers. A necessity obviously, but it meant another 2 weeks without running one step. The overwhelming numbness relegated her to awkwardly walking back and forth across the 5 meter recovery room. That she was allowed to do. If she were to stub a toe or turn an ankle or pull a quad she would have no idea. Any damage could be permanent. Worse, the new processors relaying information to and from her lower body would adapt to an injury too early in their training period and over compensate. The risk to her full recovery was too great. So she paced back and forth across a patch of synthetic rubber with heavy padding around the perimeter. 

Two grad students, Linda and Greg focused intently on the graphs that each of her footsteps created. They barely ever spoke directly to Kara.

Her legs wanted to run.

Eventually a prickly sensation returned to her fingertips but it faded in and out through the day. She was told that she could start eating solid food again, but with a limited sense of taste she had little motivation for it. She stuck to the dull flavorless nutrient paste that another part of the research group was working on.

At night Kara would call Kenzie to ask how Rupert was doing. She had called wanting to complain about her rehab, but she never did. Instead she asked to hear stories about her nephew. She heard about how he was walking really well all on his own now, and when Kara could get back out to see them they could walk together. Kenzie delivered these stories chilled and direct. Kara would hang up and try to sleep in a body that felt like a freshly pulled tooth. A heart that felt dull and lonely.

When the team, on Dr. Mboya’s orders, gradually stepped down the pain blockers, the feeling of anything touching Kara’s skin was enough to send her into fits. The entire world felt sharp and abrasive. Cold and hot were concepts with no gradient between them. Everything hurt or burned or felt numb. All the time. She wore only the softest elastic running shorts and shirt to rehab. Even those pushed the boundaries of what was tolerable. Linda and Greg nodded at each other studiously and wrote down each time Kara muttered and didn’t complain openly. The charts on their monitors spiking with each step.

After 2 days of this Dr. Dawson walked into the recovery room, looked at her tablet and made a few adjustments with her fingertips. 

She stared at her tablet for a moment, said “that’s better” and walked back out of the room. 

Kara sethed silently. She rounded on her heel and crossed the rubber mat for the 143rd time that morning. Linda and Greg tapped excitedly at a waveform that now had its peaks rounded off.

Dr. Dawson was right. It was better. Kara felt better. Incomparably better. The constant stinging on the surface of her skin dulled in an instant. Her sense of touch just had the volume knob turned down. Kara couldn’t decide what was enraging her. Was it the careless nonchalance of Dr. Dawson, the lack of explanation, or the fact that she had walked into the room and changed Kara’s perceptions with a brush of her fingers? Linda and Greg chittered to one another, pointed at new graphs, and didn’t really look in Kara’s direction.

All Kara wanted to be able to do was run. Why wasn’t that as easy as tapping on a tablet? The 144th trip she hopped lightly from one foot to the other. Greg and Linda raised their eyebrows, but whatever they were thinking, they didn’t share it with Kara.

Week 3 and 4 were a whirlwind. The pain and discomfort faded quickly, but every other sensation seemed to have the intensity gradually turned up. Kara could feel the air move through her lungs with each breath. Small eddies swirling against the topology of her bronchi. She became acutely aware of the surfaces she touched deforming the ridges of her fingerprints. She could focus on and engage strands of muscle in her legs independently. Everything tasted intensely salty or sweet or sour. Except coffee. Coffee tasted like coffee again. When she described this to Kenzie over the phone her eyes welled up. Kenzie said that was silly because all of this was in the timeline.

By the end of week 4 she could pick up a pencil and write in cursive with her toes. That hadn’t been in the timeline.
 
Greg and Linda had gone off somewhere to compile and sift through an embarrassingly detailed record of Kara’s nervous system over the past month. She wasn’t particularly happy about it, but as Dr. Dawson always reminded her, she had signed the release form.

Ultimately, these were fleeting concerns. What Kara was thinking about right now was running. 

Her newly restored spine offered a level of precision control over every movement that was so revelatory that it was like training to run her first 5K all over again. Managing her stride seemed secondary to controlling her heart rate and blood flow. Breathing was no longer a rhythm tied to her foot falls. It was an efficiency calculation driven by the demand of her muscles and the speed of her metabolism.

Kara had never felt more calm while running. She had never felt more exhilarated. Rehab was still rehab, of course. The research team kept her on a pretty tight leash only allowing her to do a few laps of the track at a time before stopping her to check data and reapply sensor pads damn near everywhere. Even with the help of advanced, experimental, Dr. Dawson led  treatments, rehab was still rehab. One step at a time. She could hear Kenzie repeating it over and over. One Step at a time.

“Are your toes numb?”

Kara was towelling off on one of the wooden benches along the edge of the university running track. She plucked her headphones from her ears and looked up at Dr. Dawson. Trailing her was the small entourage of grad students, interns, and residents that made up her research team. There were a few new faces that Kara didn’t recognize. They all kept a considerable distance from her. Kara felt very conscious of the nearly healed port on her back.

“Hello Dr. Dawson.” Kara made a small waving gesture with the towel. “Team. New Team.” She waved again, specifically directing it toward the people she didn’t recognize. “No, my toes are fine. I still have that one spot on the back of my left knee that goes all pins and needles though. And my forearms are itchy. Bit of a rash.”

Kara held out her arms, palms up. The Grad students looked them over appraisingly, nodding and making notes. Dr. Dawson glanced once and returned to her tablet. 

“Knee might be a software problem. Or a delaminating junction. I’ll consult with Dr. Mboya when he gets back.”

“Oh, Where did he go?”

Dr. Dawson paused for a moment as if dazed.

“Why would I know?”

“I don’t know? I was just curious?” Kara felt off balance but wasn’t sure how she got there.

Greg and Linda had wandered over from their monitoring stations. Greg held up a finger in an over exaggerated interjection. “I think he said he was going to the lake. They have a cabin.” 

Dr. Dawson blinked a few times and smiled slightly. 

“I’m Sorry. That sounded rude didn’t it. Dr. Mboya is on vacation until the end of the week, but I didn’t ask where he was going.” Dr. Dawson looked back at her tablet. “ And the rash is from dust mites. You’re more susceptible now. Could one of you clean Ms. Lui’s sheets for her?”

With that Dr. Dawson pivoted and strode back across the track with the entourage in tow. Kara wanted to ask if she could attempt a longer run, a 2000m or even a slow 5k, but she held it in.

Greg and Linda both waved at Kara sheepishly promising to take care of her sheets as they backed away.

Kara stood and shook out her ankles. One more easy jog around the track.

Kara asked Kenzie that night if she remembered mom. She didn’t know beforehand that she was going to ask about their mom, It sort of just rolled out of her. Kenzie was silent and still so long that Kara thought she had gotten disconnected. Kara heard a soft murmur of “m-hmm” from the other end of the line. Kenzie told her that Rupert had started to venture outside on the balcony, but always ran right back in when the neighbor cat was outside. 

Just past the halfway point of her prescribed rehab period, Kara ran a 1500m in 4 minutes 3 seconds. 15 seconds slower than the current world record. She hadn’t even felt that fast during the run. She could feel her legs pounding out a consistent rhythm, her feet landing on the track. but she had been focused on maintaining her blood oxygen levels to keep her lactic acid production at bay. She had been thinking about how it felt when she consciously manipulated her heart rate and blood vessel dilation. The pace she was running wasn’t really on her mind. Linda had insisted that she not try to run faster right now. They had research data to crunch and they couldn’t risk Kara injuring herself in the middle of rehab. 

Kara knew that she could run faster, but she acquiesced to the researchers wishes. After all this was just one more step on the way to her making a full recovery. It was tough not to dwell on the fact that this ‘one step’ was the fastest she had ever run in her life. In a middle distance race no less. Those legs of hers had absolutely crushed her old personal best.

It only took 2 minutes 23 seconds to return to her resting heart rate.

She looked down at her legs and shook them out by the side of the track. They wanted to run.

Kara had thought that no one from the press would be particularly interested in her recovery. Rehab from this sort of injury was nothing new. She was an Olympic team hopeful, but no one would ever describe her as a star. She didn’t have the effusive, performative personality that some of her better known peers seemed to wield so effortlessly. She had no real skill in self promotion. In a biting bit of observation her sister would often call her ‘reserved’. It wasn’t Kara herself that they wanted to see. Not really. 

The research project Dr. Dawson worked under was, at least in part, publicly funded. That meant that anonymized data was regularly published to the university’s forward facing website. Part of Kara’s recovery and rehab included using the track and recording times at the track. It wasn’t too difficult to figure out that the girl with the shattered spine was up and running 1500m close to the national record.

They weren’t looking to interview an athlete, they were calling to build a story. It was a story they could run as the last segment before commercial break. A story they could add as a sidebar to upcoming Olympic coverage. A feel good story.

The writer from Runners World who showed up in person and had to talk to Kara through a plexiglass barrier seemed particularly hung up on the fact that she was a long distance runner and not a sprinter or middle distance specialist. He mentioned several times in a way that Kara was certain he thought was flattering, that she didn’t even have a sprinters physique. She had not found it flattering. She gave him the same answer she gave the rest of the reporters. She credited Dr. Dawson, Dr. Mboya, and their teams for her recovery, but she stopped short of crediting them with her speed. She trained hard for that speed. Her legs worked years for that speed. The new spine was helping her use what was already there. Just like any rehab, this was all about getting her back on her feet. Getting her running again.

Kara’s years of training never seemed to be part of these feel good stories.

When Kenzie called, she asked about Kara’s rhythm and split pace. She asked about her hydration schedule after so much time away from training. She sheepishly told Kara that she had entered the local Mommy 5k and was worried about all her time away from running too. Kara told her that sounded like a good idea. 

Three days later the team let her run a 5k. Kara ran a 13.40 flat. If she had been competing, she would now hold the women’s world record.

Two days after that she broke the men’s.

One and a half months ago she couldn’t wiggle her toes. Kara was now the fastest person in the world. At least on this track under these conditions.  She wouldn’t be nearly this fast on a road course. Not yet.


Kenzie called her later that same day and Kara neglected to mention her run times. Instead she asked Kenzie what was going on with her. Alex wanted to walk everywhere on his own and hated being picked up unless he was tired. She also reported that Rupert had gotten out and came back with a cold, but he was fine. Just sneezing and sleeping. Then she went quiet for a while. Kenzie said she had to go. Alex needed something. She didn’t say what. Kara knew she was lying but agreed and said she looked forward to seeing them soon since her quarantine period had ended. Kenzie said “mm-hmm” and hung up.

When they all came down to the university to see her, Kenzie seemed preoccupied. They visited for a while before Micheal gathered Alex up and said that he was going to show him the dinosaur skeletons in the walkway. A convincing enough excuse to leave the two sisters alone together for a few minutes.

Kenzie made a show of silently looking over some of the research equipment.

“You asked me before if I remembered mom.” Kenzie’s voice carried an edge of anger but she kept her back to Kara “Of course I do.”

“I don’t really. I was 4.”

“I was 13.” The words hissed out of Kenzie. “I was 13 and you were 4. And dad was broken. He’s still broken.” Kenzie spat the last part.

Kara walked a wide arc around Kenzie to see her sister in profile. She was covering her eyes with a hand. 

“Why this all of a sudden? What did I do?”

“I read the site Kara. I know how fast you ran. How fast you can run. Why don’t you tell me these things. Why don’t you tell me anything.” Kenzie’s anger cracked and made way for choked sobs. Kenzie never cried. Never.

“I do. I do tell you things.” Kara kept stumbling over words trying to get everything she felt out all at once. ”This is just a flat track. I’m not even done my rehab. You have a family. You have other things to worry about.” 

“I worry about you, dummy.” Kenzie uncovered her face and Kara couldn’t think of one good reason that she hadn’t told her sister about her track times. Not one. “I’ve worried about you since you were 4. And I was 13.”

Kara felt around in herself. She felt the rhythm of her breathing. The changes in her blood flow. She could feel the action of her tear ducts and the involuntary contraction of the muscles along her sides. The slight change in temperature as her short breaths flowed along her arm. Every fluctuation of her heart.

Kenzie’s voice floated to her, weak and trembling. “I did the best I could, you know.” 

“I know. Thanks.”


The email message that came in from the Olympic Committee was not the one that Kara had been expecting. 

It was very official looking and read like a team of lawyers wrote it during an all nighter. 

A warning had come in from on high. Several countries had written a joint complaint to the international committee letting them know that they would be looking to file Kara’s spine as a regulated performance enhancing technology. Zhang and Winstead would be in the clear, because their prosthetics only restored function. Kara’s stepped over the line, they argued. It had already been decided, the petition would be successful. Kara would be barred from competing. Of course she could just withdraw her name from consideration and that would be that. No need to raise a stink over it.

There were appeals. Demonstrations of the technology. Dr. Dawson hated having investigators from the IOC in her lab, but she allowed it. Kara hated having them poke at the port between her shoulder blades, but she allowed it. Kara was told, in no uncertain terms, that the investigation would not be complete in time for the games. At least not these games.

In the end, she pulled her name. 

Kara felt numb. The truck had hit her again, but this time it got everything.

Kara watched the opening ceremonies on Kenzie’s couch. Alex ran from the footstool to the armchair and back again over and over and over. Rupert stayed on Kara’s lap far from Alex’s path. She stroked him behind his ears. Kenzie cooked fried rice and tofu.

Kara slid her finger across the tablet in 3 slow swipes dragging each of the nerve acceleration sliders all the way down. A quick tap of the tablet put the processors into passive mode. This, she was told, were the settings for baseline function. She confirmed the on screen notification asking if this is what she wanted. This was the closest she would ever be to how she felt before the accident. A wave of tingles swept from the top of her head to the tip of her toes. When the wave subsided her entire body felt like it was wrapped in heavy cotton. Too cold in some places, too hot in others. She hated it.

Kara shook out her ankles and wrists, rolled her neck a few times and loosened up her shoulders. She tested her balance from foot to foot. Breathed in and felt for the alveoli activating in her lungs. Barely anything there. She had trouble imagining that anyone could ever live this way. It was like having all of the lights dimmed after spending months walking in the sunshine.

She looked down at her legs. They seemed so far away now, attached to some distant part of herself, but she could tell that they were ready. They wanted to run.

She thought about regulating her oxygen levels, maintaining a steady heart cadence, engaging her muscles smoothly and efficiently. She concentrated on the distant feeling of energy exchange and temperature regulation. Kara’s body was a machine built for running. Her control of that machine was second to none.

She could hear Kenzie in her head calmly talking over race strategy with every step. Every stride. Every breath.

10k. Kenzie held up the stopwatch for Kara to see. 

26:15:36. Three and a half seconds behind the world record.

“Think you can beat that?”

“Will you be coaching me?”

“Of course.”

“Then, yes.”
