I'm told this is normal. This is to be expected. The good news is when you are writing you have the ability to change what words go where and what characters say and when. I still have characters that don't 'talk to me' but I'm very definitely finding ones that do. I don't really pick what they say, I just listen and write it down when they say it. That is sort of cool. Hopefully that will make the second draft easier to lay down than the first. Hopefully that will make the second draft better than the first. I doubt it though. Probably won't be properly 'okay' until the 3rd or 4rth draft.&nbsp;</div>
