That&rsquo;s no lie. <br>- Ron Burgundy <br></div>  <div class="wsite-youtube" style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;"><div class="wsite-youtube-wrapper wsite-youtube-size-auto wsite-youtube-align-center"> 	<div class="wsite-youtube-container">                  		<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VTmJJ0lUyQc?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> 	</div> </div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">Unless someone can prove otherwise, I think that the music for bubble Bobble may just be the happiest music ever written.&nbsp;<br><br>There was a Bubble Bobble machine at the front of the candy store in my hometown. It sat beside a Jackal machine, or Top Gunner, if you&rsquo;re a heathen. Since you could drive a Jeep over dudes and launch missiles at tanks in Jackal, Bubble Bobble didn&rsquo;t get much love. But while you stood there fighting tyranny, or whatever it was you were supposed to be doing in Jackal, that Bubble Bobble machine was bleeding pure joy.&nbsp;<br><br>Everything in Bubble Bobble floats. The bubbles your little dinosaur creature exhales zip rapidly across the screen before drifting lazily upward. The enemy creatures you trap in those bubbles rock gently like leaves on the wind. Your jump follows a slow breezy arc, rising briskly and falling back down with a sleepy pace. Gravity is daydreaming.<br><br>Happy Music. Happy movement. Happy Game.<br></div>
