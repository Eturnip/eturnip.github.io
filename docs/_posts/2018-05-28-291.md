<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">I've been doing some more work on the story<a href="../story-007---unfinished.html" target="_blank"> over here</a>&nbsp;. I actually ended up writing some more stuff in part one, or chapter one, or whatever you call parts of stories. I tacked that on, but I haven't quite caught up with the other stuff I had been writing so that I could figure out how to write this stuff. It's a wacky non-linear world of writing. The real kicker is, I absolutely know for a fact that I will end up completely rewriting pretty much everything in the first chapter or so to make it flow better with everything else. I think I have made peace with that.&nbsp;<br>Next week I think I'll write about working on a board game. Won't that be fun.&nbsp;<br></div>
