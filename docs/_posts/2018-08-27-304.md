<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">I keep plunking away on <a href="../story-007---unfinished.html" target="_blank">this story.</a>&nbsp;The next scene isn't quite done so I didn't add it to the website.&nbsp;I did a bunch of work and planning for upcoming scenes though, to better fit a more episodic structure. Since this update is only a handful of words and some edits I briefly considered posting up a synopsis, but just giving away the whole story doesn't seem very fun. So, for now, you will just have to make due with this small change. You can also safely skip this one and wait for next week when I will have the first part of chapter 3 done.</div>
