				<div class="paragraph"><span><span>At the end of a year you are supposed to look back at what you did, the things that happened, what you learned. I did some game dev work on the art side, I did some game dev work on the coding side, I did some previz and mapping work, I did some prop modelling, I did some writing, I did some graphic design. Having a logo I designed show up on Japanese, British, and American websites is pretty fun. I learned several new tools, did some work with powershell and python scripts, and experimented with art styles I&rsquo;m not used to. Creatively and professionally it\s been a pretty good year. Here&rsquo;s hoping that 2020 is as good or better.</span></span><br><span></span><br></div>
