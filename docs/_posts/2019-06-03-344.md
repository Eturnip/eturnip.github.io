<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">A lot of small changes <a href="../story-007---unfinished.html" target="_blank">over here</a> while I work on the scenes and changes in other parts of the story. I'll be lifting out entire chunks and rewriting them to make the story flow better. I've been working on this for a while, and only now have I figured out how to use the planning parts of the writing software I'm using. Just been scratching all my plans and ideas down in another document until now. They actually have tools for that sort of thing, and it turns out they work pretty well. Strange?</div>
