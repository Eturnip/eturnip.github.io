<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">I was about nearing the end of this short story when I realized that the story isn't actually about what I though it was about. I think this is probably a pretty common occurrence. Scripts often go through many rewrites, adjusting and molding the story the entire time. Short stories&nbsp; are the same. I have been going back over it and cutting out a lot of cruft. It feels similar to sculpting. cept with words. and mud. always there is mud.&nbsp;<br>Anyway don't read it, because it's not done but <a href="../story-11.html" target="_blank">it's over here</a> if you don't follow directions well.<br></div>
