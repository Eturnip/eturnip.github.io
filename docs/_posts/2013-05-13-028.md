<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;">Really short update today. <br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>I&rsquo;ve just been doing some more work on creating and setting up models for import into the game.&nbsp;UV unwraps, zeroing out transforms, organizing materials, that sort of thing. I have a couple of longer post and Best Games in various states of construction, but none of them felt done enough to post today. I&rsquo;ll polish one of them up for next week. <br><br>If anyone is interested in any longer technical writeups, something on modelling or maybe a video on some topic, let me know. I would like to try doing a video on some topic, but every time I think of something, I always go &ldquo;nah. that would be boring&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll let you be the judge, what would you not find boring?<br><br></div>
