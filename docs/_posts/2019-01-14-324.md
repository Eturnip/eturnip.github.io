<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">A small amount of movement <a href="../story-007---unfinished.html" target="_blank">over here</a>. I was getting hung up on a scene so I jumped ahead and wrote some of the stuff after it. That leaves a big 'write this here' hole so I only included all the new stuff that actually makes sense to the continuity. As always, I have to issue this warning. This is an in progress rough draft of something that will likely be novella length. If you have ever wanted to read and comment on a story while it's being written, please be my guest. If you would rather wait until I have something that works from end to end and I have done at least some polish work on it, stay tuned and I will let you know.<br></div>
