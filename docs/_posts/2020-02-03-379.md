				<div class="paragraph"><span><span>This past weekend was Global Game Jam. This will be the tenth GGJ that I have attended but the first time that the game I worked on doesn&rsquo;t play on a computer. I teamed up with Paul and Logan Cooper to work on a board game. A 3D printed board game. In 48 hours.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>3D printing is not a quick process. It does provide regular people with the facility to create physical objects relatively easily and cheaply, but rapid prototyping is only rapid when compared to other forms of manufacture. We shifted the usual Game Jam constraint of technology over to a constraint of logistics. Getting everything designed, modelled, printed, and tested in 48 hours was tricky.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>In the end we completed and play tested the prototype of an actually interesting table-top game. It plays in less than an hour. There are some interesting strategic elements. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to learn. After a few more revisions, I have no doubt that it could be quite fun.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>Given the time we had to create it, we didn&rsquo;t get a chance to test it with more than 2 players, but it does seem like more players could work very well. That might even be the prefered way to play it.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span>Anyway, if you have a 3d printer and wanted to test out an interesting game prototype, you can download the files here&nbsp; </span><span style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-weight:400"><a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/treasuretrap-dungeon-game-8">https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/treasuretrap-dungeon-game-8</a></span></span><br><span></span></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-none " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/1/1/9/3/11936545/img-20200202-155627_orig.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%"> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>
