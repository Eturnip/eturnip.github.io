<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">More progress <a href="../story-007---unfinished.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I thought that I was about 3 scenes from the end of part one, but realized that the story needed 2 more. I will also be extending and expanding at least 2 of the scenes from chapter one. I also realized that while I have chapter and scene breaks in my working copy, the version I post up on the site is one long chunk of text. I think it is growing past the point where reading something like that is practical or enjoyable. I'll make some revisions next week to split that stuff up, and I think I'll start posting an epub version that people can download to phones or e-readers. I don't expect many people will, but I have a few ideas about how I would like to release these stories that mean I should get used to exporting common formats.&nbsp;</div>
