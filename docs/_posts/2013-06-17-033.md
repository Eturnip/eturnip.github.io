Instead I put it on its own page. You can click the link at the top or bottom of this post to mess around with it.&nbsp;<br><br>I tossed a jumble of models together to approximate the kind of stuff that will go on at the top of the screen during the game. If you fiddle with the knobs you can adjust a bunch of the settings in the shader. It will freak right out when you first start playing with it, but you can pretty easily adjust it to something reasonable. There is only one shader in this scene and no lights. Everything is adjusted, tinted, slid, tweaked, and modified through careful use of a few variables.<br><br><a href="../033---shader-test.html">This is the link to the Shader Test</a></div>
