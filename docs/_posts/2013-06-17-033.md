If you fiddle with the knobs you can adjust a bunch of the settings in the shader. It will freak right out when you first start playing with it, but you can pretty easily adjust it to something reasonable. There is only one shader in this scene and no lights. Everything is adjusted, tinted, slid, tweaked, and modified through careful use of a few variables.<br><br><a href="../033---shader-test.html">This is the link to the Shader Test</a></div>
