I have enjoyed writing it. <br><br>But. <br><br>I have some good news and some bad news. <br><br>First the bad news. I ending the blog and all other game creation activities. It&rsquo;s been a long time, most of my life really, but I have lost all interest in games. I am going to stop writing about them, playing them, and making them. But there is a good reason for it. <br><br>The good news is, I&rsquo;m ending my 35+ year long interest in games, and video games in particular, to follow my heart. My love of dance. <br><br>If anyone would care to join me, I will be presenting my one man exploration of interpretive movement on June 14th.<br><br></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:center;"><strong style="">&ldquo;My left, and also my right, foot : an evening of Dancechantment&rdquo;</strong><br><br>7:20pm at the Fox Valley Community Hall, Fox Valley Sask.<br><br>Coffee and cabbage rolls will be provided by Mrs. Vilve Yachke<br>Everyone give her a big thank you.<br><br>See you there!<br></div>
