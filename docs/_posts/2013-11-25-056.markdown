				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">I'm just going to have a short conversation with myself, if you don't mind. Go about your business, I'll be done soon. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Hey Owen. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Hey. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>How's it been going? <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Can't complain. You? <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Been good. So I have a question for you. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Sure. What's up? <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Do you remember post number 007?<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Maybe. Why? <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Do you remember what that was about? <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>That was almost a year ago, man. I don't remember last week.<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>We'll you said that Adventure Caddie would launch this year. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Yeah. I might have said that. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>And the year is almost over. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Yep. Yep. That's true. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>So? <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>So, yeah. I suppose that won't be happening. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>So, why then? <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Well, okay, here it is. I figured that by the end of the year I would have something ready enough that I could post it up as an alpha and have people test it out. Launch can really mean a lot of things in these crazy modern times. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>So then nothing this year? <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Nope. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Why not? Where did you drop the ball? <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>It's pretty easy really. I didn't get enough art done to get the game into a presentable state. Rich has done a great job on the programming end, and it does sort of function, but I haven't finished nearly enough assets and gotten them game-ready. The game works, but there is nothing to do yet. It's a 100 piece puzzle with 7 available pieces and some of those are taken from other boxes.<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Is it ever going to get done?<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Yeah. Oh yes, definitely. I&rsquo;m working on those assets right now. I can only work about 2 uninterrupted hours a day, so it&rsquo;s slow work.<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>That sounds like an excuse.<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>You&rsquo;re probably right. Yes, you&rsquo;re right, it is. I&rsquo;ll work harder. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>So when will people be able to play with it?<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>I&rsquo;m not doing that again. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Learned your lesson?<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Yes. No more promises. It&rsquo;s done when it&rsquo;s done. Can I make deadlines, but just not tell everyone?<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Yes. In fact, I think you have to do that. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Sounds good. So Adventure Caddie, still working on it, and it will be available&hellip; sometime. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Works for Blizzard. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Not fair. They have all the money. <br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>Bah, give it up. You don&rsquo;t have any problems.<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>You&rsquo;re right. Okay, fair enough. Thanks, me.<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><span style=""></span>No Thank you, me.<br style=""><span style=""></span><br style=""><br style=""></div>
