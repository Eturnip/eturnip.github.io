				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style=""><span style="">This is post 104. That means that I have written one post per week for two years. Most of the posts are just throwaway bits of hack writing, but once in a while I managed to string together a few cogent points using comprehensible sentences. If anyone is keeping score, I&rsquo;m probably still running a minus on my stats. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span><span style="">I started this one post per week writing schedule so that I would be forced to practice communicating ideas clearly. I&rsquo;m really not sure if I&rsquo;m getting any better at it, but I&rsquo;ll check back in around post 208 and we&rsquo;ll find out. </span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span><span style="">Next week I have a post about building things with some pictures, so that should be nice. After that, it will probably be back to the usual 1000 words or so of videogame talk. I might mix it up a bit though. Maybe talk about cartoons. </span></span></div>
