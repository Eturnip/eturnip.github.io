<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">You know that show thing that I was working on, the one where I try to gather a sketch group together to draw, paint, sculpt, animate, or whatever, all while jawing about the stuff that populates our heads. Yeah that thing. Well we are still doing it, and we have done more than 10 of them. I have been reluctant to invite many guests on to the show, since actually recording it and putting it together is more involved than a lot of people would be willing to deal with. I'm in the process of fixing that, and as you can see, we probably have room for one or two more at the table. Until I have it fully ironed out, here you go, you can enjoy this one below, and ten more like it over <a href="../5feat-video.html">here</a>&nbsp;. I am also setting up an audio only version, if you prefer to imagine what we are creating while we talk directly into your ear holes. Whatever, that's your business.&nbsp;</div>  <div class="wsite-youtube" style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:10px;"><div class="wsite-youtube-wrapper wsite-youtube-size-auto wsite-youtube-align-center"> <div class="wsite-youtube-container">  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PY0rBH_J3k?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> </div></div>
