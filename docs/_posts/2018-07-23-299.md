<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">A small bit of movement on the story <a href="../story-007---unfinished.html" target="_blank">over here</a>.&nbsp; As soon as I have one of my characters talk to another one of my characters, I first have to go and make sure that I know who they are, and that requires writing some other background and even a couple of test conversations. It's a slow constructions process, but hopefully it will be worth it in the end. I'm resisting the urge to go back in and rewrite stuff at the start that I find clunky, because I at least want to write up until the first major plot point before I start reworking earlier stuff. I have a couple of scenes later on already written, it's just a matter of filling in the space between here and there. I think this is why most writers don't put stuff out until they have at least one full draft. Too bad I guess. If you read it now you have to suffer the halting sentences and jarring pace.&nbsp;</div>
