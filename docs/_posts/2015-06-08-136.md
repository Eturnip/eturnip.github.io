<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span style=""><span style="">When I decided to disassemble the arcade stick that had been hastily constructed from happ controls sticks and buttons, some scrap wood with oil stains on it, and several liberally applied layers of paint to hide said oil stains, I thought it would be a couple week project. That was almost 7 years ago. The cabinet I designed and built to replace the arcade stick was originally intended to contain a modified original xbox. It has 3 shelves to hold any old consoles I had kicking around.</span><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span><span style="">7 years is a long time, and I gave the happ sticks and buttons away several years ago. Now the heart of the machine is a raspberry pi 2 single board computer running a stipped down linux. The sticks are Ultimarc Ultrastik 360 digital/analog programmable powerhouses that didn&rsquo;t exist when I drew up the router files to cut the cabinet. The screen, originally intended to be a large rear projection unit, is a cheap lcd mounted to the wall. &nbsp;Almost nothing about this cabinet is as I had originally planned. It works fantastically, the games play great, and I like how it looks. It feels good to be finished it. The next one I build might be made out of metal. </span><br></span></div>  <div><div style="height:20px;overflow:hidden"></div> <div id='923519781180224634-slideshow'></div>
