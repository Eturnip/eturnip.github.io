				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><strong>Modelling with Owen</strong><br><br>If you've read any of these posts you will notice that my initial intent to write about the development of a game fell off pretty much instantly. I figure I'll write about whatever is jangling around in my noggin. I'll attempt to keep it to games, not that will be too difficult since those are usually the thoughts doing the jangling. This week I was thinking about modelling a game character, so if that is what you showed up for you are in luck. If not you can watch this anyway. It's only fifteen minutes long, there is a subtitled&nbsp;commentary, and I put some nice classical music in there to back up the visuals. It's sort of relaxing. <br></div>  <div class="wsite-youtube" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><object width="500" height="412"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/fhFEyf0cQWs?version=3"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/fhFEyf0cQWs?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="transparent" width="500" height="412"></object></div></div>
