I took part in the Ludum Dare game jam this weekend and thought "what if I couldn't use any of my normal tools. No 3D. No graphics. Just text and a lot of scripting. So I installed the new version of twine, a text adventure engine, and tried to make a mostly random story-type experience. This is what I came up with in 48hrs, while also learning how scripting in twine works. It's weird. Enjoy.
