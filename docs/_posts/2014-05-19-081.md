There are roughly twenty seven thousand tweaks, additions, and adjustments that I could still make. I suppose I could say that I hit a plateau. Every button is wired up and working. The sticks function beautifully. I still need to rig up a stand for the tv, but any TV or monitor could, as Intended, be used as a display. Smash TV plays great too, the only downside being that you can only play it single player. I can get around the shortage of arcade sticks by plugging in a 360 controller for a second player, but that is really missing the point of having a stand up arcade machine in your home. <br><span></span><br><span></span>We'll say, for now, everything works great, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. <br></div>  <div><div class="wsite-image wsite-image-border-border-width:0 " style="padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-left:10px;margin-right:10px;text-align:center"> <a> <img src="/uploads/1/1/9/3/11936545/1400515517.jpg" alt="Picture" style="width:auto;max-width:100%"> </a> <div style="display:block;font-size:90%"></div> </div></div>
