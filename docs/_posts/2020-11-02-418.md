I think I would like to make more of this sort of thing. Miniatures, figurines, toys. When I work on the game I'm making, I think of all the characters in terms of action figures and toys. They have to look like they are meant to be played with. The robot characters I designed for Neon Noodles have an air of "miniature" about them. I've sort of always wanted to make stuff like this guy. I suppose this printer is one more tool to making that happen.</div>
