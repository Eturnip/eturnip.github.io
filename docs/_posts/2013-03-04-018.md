<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;">I wanted to create a small sample scene of actual assets from Adventure Caddie. I&rsquo;m only now coming to grips with the rigging and animation systems in blender, so I opted instead to use a bunch of primitives and some character models culled from the Unity asset store. I think the test still gets the look across. Here's four minutes of me twiddling knobs.<br></div>  <div class="wsite-youtube" style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><object width="400" height="330"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/qLsZdEP2XVI?version=3"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/qLsZdEP2XVI?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" wmode="transparent" width="400" height="330"></object></div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;">This is a video clip of me playing with the shader I created for the game. The scene has no lights. All the effects are controlled by a couple of sliders hooked to range variables, some colors, and one texture. For this test scene I&rsquo;m only using one material, but setting up multiple materials for all the objects is pretty easy. The only extra bit of management that we will have to build is a sort of lighting board control system, so that different layers, and objects in the scene can be controlled as groups, rather than having to tune them all one at a time. <br></div>
