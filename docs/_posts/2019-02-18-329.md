<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph">Some slow progress <a href="../story-007---unfinished.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I also went back through the first two chapters and made some notes about things that I will change on an edit pass. There are at least 4 scenes that are in completely the wrong spot and quite a lot of fleshing out to do, but hopefully it's salvageable. I suppose I will only know that when I get closer to the end.&nbsp;</div>
