				<div class="paragraph"><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">When The Tragically Hip album Fully Completely came out in 1992, I bought it a copy, and also received one as a gift. One was a CD, one was a cassette, but I don&rsquo;t remember which. The sensible move might have been to sell one copy, or give it to a friend, but that wasn&rsquo;t what I did. I kept the cd in the house and I took the tape out to the shop. The stereo I had out there was a tinny, scratchy little thing, but sound came out of it when tapes went into it, so it served my purposes. For a good long time, the only tapes that nestled into that little deck were Fully Completely, Pearl Jam&rsquo;s Ten, and maybe some Soundgarden.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">The shop, like a lot of farm buildings, is a large, rectangular, steel clad structure on a concrete pad. Unlike a lot of farm buildings, the shop is heated and, aside from an ever present whiff of &nbsp;gasoline and diesel fuel, fairly clean. In 1992, that is where the computer was. In 1992 that was where I would be. I would turn on the stereo, and play Wing Commander or X-Wing well into the night. Occasionally, well into the morning, Fully Completely on loop.</span></span><br><span></span><span><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0)">When At the Hundredth Meridian comes on the radio, it still makes me think of flying though space.</span></span><br><span></span></div>
