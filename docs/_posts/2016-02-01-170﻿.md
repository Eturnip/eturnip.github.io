				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><span><span>Yesterday I sat nestled in the back of a classroom designed to accommodate dozens of students with just three other people. Joel Barr, Logan Cooper, Scott Wilson, and myself teamed up to create the game Panel Handlers. Over the 48 (or so) hour duration of the Global Game Jam, we succeeded, failed, and learned in roughly equal amounts, and in every order that you could possibly arrange those words. </span></span><br><span></span><span><span>Every year that I take part in this game jam, I always end off wishing we could have accomplished more. The next day I&rsquo;m always amazed we accomplished as much as we did. As it turns out 48 hours is not very much time. </span></span><br><span></span><span><span>With that in mind, you can go here and enjoy the result of a lot of learning, failing, and succeeding that happened in Calgary over the last 48 hours. &nbsp;</span></span><br><span></span><span><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/global-game-jam-calgary/games"><span>http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/global-game-jam-calgary/games</span></a></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>Thank you to the rest of my team for making every hour of that time enjoyable.</span></span><br><span></span></div>
